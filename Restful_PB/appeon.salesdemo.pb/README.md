 This application contains examples on calling Web APIs via RESTClient. Therefore, for the application to run successfully, it is necessary to enable the Web APIs by the following steps:

1.	Open the salesdemo_ds project
2.	Check if the database configuration in the project and the database in your environment are consistent to ensure proper database connection. 
3.	Verify if the solutionâ€™s folder in the project configuration exists in your environment (modify it yourself if it does not exist).
4.	Execute Generate & Build Project.
5.	After step 4 is successful, click on the Run Project menu.
6.	Ensure step 5 is successful and the salesdemo_restful target runs properly in the IDE.

Note: The Host and Port settings in the project launchSettings shall match the configuration in the apisetup.ini file located in the application directory.
